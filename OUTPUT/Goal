Goal: This folder contains all of the data for this project.
You should AT LEAST the data include the initial data, and the final data analyzed. If needed, the code in the SCRIPTS folder should be able to get you from the initial piece of data to the final one. N.B. If the initial and final data are the same, then just include that dataset.
If your data fits in github, place all of it here.
If your data does not fit in GitHub use a single file explaining the process to obtain the dataset.
A Data Appendix file as a PDF, which will include text that you type, as well as tables, figures, and other descriptive statistics. 
This file should be organized in sections, with a section for each dataset analyzed. Each section should begin with a statement of what the unit of observation is--that is, it should explain what kind of object each row of the data file represents. 
After that, you should include a subsection for each variable in the analyzed dataset.
