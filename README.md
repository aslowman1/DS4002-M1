### Group Leader: Nina Ysabel Alinsonorin 
### Group 2: Grace Guinan & Addison Lowman 

## (1) Software and Platform
- Software type: R Studio
- Package: schrute
- Platform: Mac/Windows

 ## (2) A Map of Documentation 
- This repository contains the contents necessary to implement our sentiment analysis which consists of 3 main folders. The contents of each are as follows:
- DATA FOLDER: This folder contains all of the data for this project- specifically, a csv file, "office_vader.csv", with all text dialogue from "The Office" and "theoffice.rda", which has the VADER sentiment analysis package preloaded.
- OUTPUT FOLDER: This folder contains all generated output, namely all graphs and statistical figures which we drew our analysis from.
- SCRIPTS FOLDER: This folder contains all source code for this project, including a MASTER script file (which has all other script files) and individual script files.  

## (3) Result Replication 
In this section, you should give explicit step-by-step instructions to reproduce the Results of your study. These instructions should be written in straightforward plain English, but they must be concise, but detailed and precise enough, to make it possible for an interested user to reproduce your results without much difficulty. N.B. This section will be crucial for the CS1 assignment, where you'll be required to reproduce the results of other groups. Therefore, make sure to explain this section thoroughly.
